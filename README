#### Generating Data
Training data for autoencoder can be generated by simulating the MMC network for different targets given an initial 
configuration. This can be done using the `DataGen` class which takes as input the height, width and number of channels
of the input image. For each target the MMC network will be simulated or run for a fixed number of iterations and for
each iteration corresponding arm configuration/position will be stored as PNG image in the directory corresponding to
the target. Example ddtaset can be found in the data folder.
